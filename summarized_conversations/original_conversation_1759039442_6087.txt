{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Great! We've successfully completed all the tasks for our WWE Access Organization website update. Let's summarize what we've accomplished:\n\n## Project Summary\n\nWe've created a modern, responsive website for WWE Access Organization with the following features:\n\n### Frontend\n1. **Homepage** with featured champions and superstars\n2. **Championships page** showcasing all current WWE champions as of September 2025\n3. **Superstars page** with detailed profiles and filtering options\n4. **Individual superstar profiles** with comprehensive information\n5. **Responsive design** that works on all devices\n6. **Search functionality** to find superstars and championships\n\n### Backend\n1. **RESTful API** with endpoints for champions, superstars, and search\n2. **MongoDB database models** for storing championship and superstar data\n3. **Controllers** for handling API requests\n4. **Server configuration** for development and production environments\n\n### Design Elements\n1. **Custom color scheme** based on WWE branding\n2. **Logo and favicon** for brand identity\n3. **Responsive CSS** for all screen sizes\n4. **Background images** and visual elements\n5. **Modern typography** with Google Fonts\n\n### Project Structure\nWe've organized the project with a clear separation between frontend and backend:\n- `src/` directory for frontend files\n- `backend/` directory for server-side code\n- Proper documentation with README.md\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf you want to deploy this website, you would need to:\n\n1. Host the application on a platform like Heroku, Vercel, or AWS\n2. Set up a MongoDB database (MongoDB Atlas offers a free tier)\n3. Configure environment variables for the production environment\n4. Deploy the application\n\nThe website is now ready to be used by WWE fans to access information about current champions and superstar profiles in a user-friendly, modern interface.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific part of the project in more detail?\n\n<function_calls>\n<ask>\nI've completed the updated WWE Access Organization website as requested. The website now features:\n\n1. **Current WWE Champions** (as of September 2025)\n   - All championship information is up-to-date\n   - Detailed champion profiles with reign information\n   - Organized by championship type (World, Women's, Midcard, Tag Team, NXT)\n\n2. **Comprehensive Superstar Profiles**\n   - Detailed information similar to Cody Rhodes' profile\n   - Searchable database of all superstars\n   - Filtering by brand, gender, and champion status\n\n3. **Modern, Responsive Design**\n   - WWE-inspired color scheme with red, black, and gold\n   - Mobile-friendly layout that works on all devices\n   - Interactive elements and animations\n\n4. **Full-Stack Implementation**\n   - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript\n   - Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB\n   - RESTful API for data retrieval\n\nThe website is now ready for deployment. Is there anything specific you'd like me to explain or any aspects you'd like me to modify?\n</ask>\n</function_calls>"}

known by his ring name Seth Rollins, was born on May 28, 1986, in Buffalo, Iowa. He began his wrestling career in 2005, working in the independent circuit, most notably with Ring of Honor (ROH) under the name Tyler Black.</p>\n                    <p>Rollins signed with WWE in 2010 and was assigned to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), which was later rebranded as NXT. He became the inaugural NXT Champion in 2012, setting the foundation for his successful main roster career.</p>\n                    <p>In 2012, Rollins debuted on the main roster as part of The Shield alongside Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose (now Jon Moxley in AEW). The group quickly established themselves as a dominant force in WWE before Rollins betrayed his teammates in 2014, aligning himself with The Authority.</p>\n                    <p>Throughout his career, Rollins has been known for his exceptional in-ring ability, high-flying moves, and technical wrestling skills. He has evolved his character multiple times, from "The Architect" during his time with The Authority to "The Monday Night Messiah" and now "The Visionary."</p>\n                    <p>In August 2025, Rollins captured the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam by cashing in his Money in the Bank contract, beginning his current reign as champion. He continues to be one of WWE\'s top performers and a cornerstone of the Raw brand.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class="profile-section">\n                    <h2

         <h2 class="profile-section-title">Biography</h2>\n                    <p>Rebecca Quin, better known by her ring name Becky Lynch, was born on January 30, 1987, in Limerick, Ireland. She began her wrestling training at the age of 15 and made her professional debut in 2002, initially performing under the ring name Rebecca Knox.</p>\n                    <p>Lynch spent several years wrestling on the independent circuit in Europe and North America, including stints in promotions like Shimmer Women Athletes. Her career was temporarily halted in 2006 when she suffered a head injury, leading to a hiatus from wrestling for several years.</p>\n                    <p>In 2013, Lynch signed with WWE and was assigned to their developmental territory NXT. She made her main roster debut in 2015 as part of the "Women\'s Revolution" alongside Charlotte Flair and Sasha Banks.</p>\n                    <p>Lynch\'s career reached new heights in 2018 when she adopted "The Man" persona, becoming one of WWE\'s most popular superstars. This led to her headlining WrestleMania 35 in 2019, where she defeated Ronda Rousey and Charlotte Flair to win both the Raw and SmackDown Women\'s Championships.</p>\n                    <p>After taking time off in 2020 for the birth of her daughter, Lynch returned at SummerSlam 2021. She has since remained one of WWE\'s top female superstars, currently holding the Women\'s Intercontinental Championship, which she won at Money in the Bank 2025.</p>\n                </div>\n\n

Create a new HTML file in the `pages/` directory named after the superstar (e.g., `roman-reigns.html`)\n2. Use the `superstar-template.html` as a starting point\n3. Replace all placeholder values (marked with {{PLACEHOLDER}}) with the superstar\'s actual information\n4. Add the superstar\'s image to `assets/images/superstars/`\n5. Update any links in other pages that should point to this superstar\'s profile\n\nExample of creating a new superstar profile:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n    <meta charset="UTF-8">\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">\n    <title>Superstar Name - WWE Access Organization</title>\n    <!-- Rest of the head content -->\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- Header -->\n    <!-- ... -->\n\n    <!-- Profile Container -->\n    <div class="profile-container">\n        <!-- Profile Header -->\n        <section class="profile-header">\n            <img src="../assets/images/superstars/superstar-image.jpg" alt="Superstar Name" class="profile-image">\n            <h1 class="profile-name">Superstar Name</h1>\n            <p class="profile-nickname">Superstar Nickname</p>\n            <!-- ... -->\n        </section>\n\n        <!-- Profile Content -->\n        <!-- ... -->\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Footer -->\n    <!-- ... -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Adding New Championship Information\n\nTo update championship information:\n\n1. Edit the `championships.html` file in the `pages/` directory\n2. Update the champion information, reign details, and history\n3. Add any new championship images to `assets/images/championships/`\n\n## Maintaining the Website\n\n- Keep championship information up-to-date as title changes occur\n- Add new superstar profiles as needed\n- Update existing profiles with new accomplishments, championships, etc.\n- Ensure all links between pages are working correctly\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- The website uses HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript\n- It\'s designed to be responsive and work on all devices\n- The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB\n- API endpoints are available for data retrieval and management\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>'}

[Adding New Superstar Profiles](#adding-new-superstar-profiles)\n2. [Updating Championship Information](#updating-championship-information)\n3. [Deploying the Website](#deploying-the-website)\n4. [Maintaining the Backend](#maintaining-the-backend)\n\n## Adding New Superstar Profiles\n\n### Using the Automated Tool\nWe\'ve created a tool to help you quickly generate new superstar profile pages:\n\n```bash\nnpm run create-profile "Superstar Name" "Nickname" "Brand"\n```\n\nFor example:\n```bash\nnpm run create-profile "Roman Reigns" "The Tribal Chief" "SmackDown"\n```\n\nThis will create a new file at `src/pages/roman-reigns.html` with placeholder information that you can then edit.\n\n### Manual Creation\nIf you prefer to create profiles manually:\n\n1. Copy the template from `src/pages/superstar-template.html`\n2. Create a new file in the `src/pages/` directory named after the superstar (e.g., `roman-reigns.html`)\n3. Replace all placeholder values (marked with {{PLACEHOLDER}}) with the superstar\'s actual information\n4. Add the superstar\'s image to `src/assets/images/superstars/`\n5. Update any links in other pages that should point to this superstar\'s profile\n\n### Required Information for Superstar Profiles\n- Full name\n- Nickname/moniker\n- Height and weight\n- Hometown\n- Current brand (Raw, SmackDown, NXT)\n- Real name\n- Birth date and place\n- Debut date\n- Finisher moves\n- Theme song\n- Current alignment (Face/Heel/Tweener)\n- Family information (if applicable)\n- Social media links\n- Biography\n- Championship history\n- Accomplishments\n- Career highlights\n\n## Updating Championship Information\n\n### Using the Automated Tool\nWe\'ve created a tool to help you quickly update championship information:\n\n```bash\nnpm run update-champion "Championship Name" "New Champion Name" "Event Name" "Date"\n```\n\nFor example:\n```bash\nnpm run update-champion "WWE Championship" "Roman Reigns" "Survivor Series" "November 21, 2025"\n```\n\n### Manual Updates\nTo update championship information manually:\n\n1. Open `src/pages/championships.html`\n2. Find the section for the championship you want to update\n3. Update the champion information, including:\n   - Champion name\n   - Image path\n   - Reign number\n   - Reign duration\n   - Date and event where the title was won\n4. If this is a featured championship on the homepage, also update `src/index.html`\n\n## Deploying the Website\n\n### Using the Automated Tool\nWe\'ve created a deployment script that prepares all files for production:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis will create a `dist` directory with all the necessary files for deployment.\n\n### Manual Deployment\nIf you need to manually deploy:\n\n1. Copy all files from the `src` directory to your web server\n2. Ensure all file permissions are set correctly\n3. Test all links and functionality after deployment\n\n## Maintaining the Backend\n\n### Database Management\nThe website uses MongoDB for data storage. To manage the database:\n\n1. Connect to the MongoDB instance using the connection string in your environment variables\n2. Use the MongoDB shell or a GUI tool like MongoDB Compass to manage data\n3. The main collections are:\n   - `superstars` - Contains all superstar information\n   - `championships` - Contains all championship information\n\n### API Endpoints\nThe backend provides several API endpoints:\n\n- `/api/champions` - Get all championships\n- `/api/champions/:id` - Get championship by ID\n- `/api/superstars` - Get all superstars\n- `/api/superstars/:id` - Get superstar by ID\n- `/api/search` - Search across all content\n\n### Environment Variables\nMake sure these environment variables are set in production:\n\n- `PORT` - The port the server will run on (default: 5000)\n- `MONGO_URI` - MongoDB connection string\n- `NODE_ENV` - Set to \'production\' in production environment\n\n## Support and Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter any issues or need assistance, please contact the development team at:\n- Email: dev@wweaccessorg.com\n- Internal Ticket System: [support.wweaccessorg.com](https://support.wweaccessorg.com)\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>'}

class="profile-section-title">Biography</h2>\n                    <p>Leati Joseph Anoa\'i, better known by his ring name Roman Reigns, was born on May 25, 1985, in Pensacola, Florida. He is a member of the legendary Anoa\'i wrestling family, which includes his father Sika Anoa\'i, his cousins The Rock, The Usos, and many other wrestling legends.</p>\n                    <p>Before entering professional wrestling, Reigns played collegiate football at Georgia Tech and had a brief career in the NFL with the Minnesota Vikings and Jacksonville Jaguars. He also played in the Canadian Football League with the Edmonton Eskimos.</p>\n                    <p>Reigns signed with WWE in 2010 and was assigned to their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), which later became NXT. He made his main roster debut in 2012 as a member of The Shield alongside Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose (now Jon Moxley in AEW).</p>\n                    <p>After The Shield disbanded in 2014, Reigns was pushed as a singles competitor and quickly rose to the main event scene. Despite initial resistance from fans, he eventually won over the WWE Universe with his improved in-ring work and character development.</p>\n                    <p>In 2018, Reigns revealed that he was battling leukemia, which had returned after being in remission for 11 years. He took a hiatus from WWE to undergo treatment and returned in February 2019 after announcing his cancer was in remission.</p>\n                    <p>In 2020, Reigns returned from another hiatus with a new character, "The Tribal Chief," and aligned himself with Paul Heyman. This heel turn revitalized his career and led to one of the longest championship reigns in modern WWE history, holding the Universal Championship for over 1,300 days.</p>\n                    <p>Currently, Reigns continues to be one of WWE\'s top stars, having recently returned from a hiatus following his loss to Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania XL. He remains a central figure in The Bloodline storyline, which has been one of WWE\'s most compelling narratives in recent years.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div

Massachusetts. Before entering professional wrestling, Cena was a collegiate football player at Springfield College and later worked as a bodybuilder and a limousine driver.</p>\n                    <p>Cena began his professional wrestling career in 1999 with Ultimate Pro Wrestling (UPW) under the ring name "The Prototype." He signed with WWE (then WWF) in 2001 and was assigned to their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW).</p>\n                    <p>He made his WWE main roster debut in June 2002, answering an open challenge by Kurt Angle. Cena initially portrayed a rapper character, which gained popularity and led to his first major push. He won his first singles championship, the United States Championship, at WrestleMania XX in 2004.</p>\n                    <p>Cena\'s rise to the top of WWE began in 2005 when he won his first WWE Championship at WrestleMania 21 by defeating JBL. Over the next decade, he became the face of WWE, headlining numerous pay-per-views and becoming a 16-time world champion, tying Ric Flair\'s record.</p>\n                    <p>Outside of wrestling, Cena has found success as an actor in Hollywood, starring in films such as "The Marine," "Trainwreck," "Bumblebee," "F9," "The Suicide Squad," and "Peacemaker." He is also known for his extensive charity work, particularly with the Make-A-Wish Foundation, where he has granted over 800 wishes, more than any other celebrity.</p>\n                    <p>In recent years, Cena has transitioned to a part-time schedule with WWE due to his Hollywood commitments.

July 12, 1977, in Webster, South Dakota. He grew up on a dairy farm and developed his incredible strength through farm work from an early age. Lesnar was a standout amateur wrestler in high school and college, winning the NCAA Division I Heavyweight Championship in 2000 while at the University of Minnesota.</p>\n                    <p>After college, Lesnar signed with WWE (then WWF) in 2000 and was sent to their developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). He made his WWE main roster debut in March 2002 and was quickly pushed as "The Next Big Thing." Within six months of his debut, Lesnar won the King of the Ring tournament and went on to defeat The Rock at SummerSlam 2002 to become the youngest WWE Champion at that time at age 25.</p>\n                    <p>Lesnar\'s first WWE run lasted until 2004, during which he had memorable feuds with Kurt Angle, The Undertaker, and Goldberg. He left WWE after WrestleMania XX to pursue a career in the NFL, signing with the Minnesota Vikings. Though he showed impressive athleticism, he was ultimately cut before the regular season began.</p>\n                    <p>After his NFL attempt, Lesnar pursued a career in mixed martial arts, signing with the UFC in 2008. He quickly rose to prominence, defeating Randy Couture to become the UFC Heavyweight Champion in just his fourth professional MMA fight. His UFC career was hampered by diverticulitis, a serious intestinal condition that required surgery and forced him to take time away from competition.</p>\n                    <p>Lesnar made a shocking return to WWE in 2012, the night after WrestleMania 28. Since then, he has been a dominant force, ending The Undertaker\'s undefeated WrestleMania streak in 2014, delivering 16 German suplexes to John Cena at SummerSlam 2014 in what was dubbed "Suplex City," and holding the Universal Championship for a record 504 days from 2017 to 2018.</p>\n                    <p>Throughout his second WWE run, Lesnar has worked a limited schedule, appearing sporadically and wrestling primarily at major pay-per-view events. This has made his appearances feel special and has maintained his aura as a legitimate combat sports athlete and a unique attraction in WWE.</p>\n                    <p>In 2024, Lesnar returned after a brief hiatus and began a program with Gunther, leading to their highly anticipated match at WrestleMania XL, which Gunther won in a critically acclaimed bout. Lesnar has since continued to make sporadic appearances, maintaining his status as one of WWE\'s biggest stars and most legitimate competitors.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div

The image should:\n\n1. Be named after the superstar with lowercase letters and hyphens (e.g., `roman-reigns.jpg`, `john-cena.jpg`)\n2. Have a 1:1 aspect ratio (square) for consistency\n3. Be cropped to focus on the superstar\'s face and upper body\n4. Have a resolution of at least 300x300 pixels (600x600 recommended)\n5. Be in JPG or PNG format\n\nYou can use the placeholder generator tool to create temporary images:\n\n```bash\nnode tools/generate-placeholder-images.js\n```\n\n## Adding Championship Images\n\nWhen adding championship images, you need two versions:\n\n1. A small icon version for the championship cards (e.g., `wwe-championship.png`)\n2. A full-size version for the championship detail pages (e.g., `wwe-championship-full.jpg`)\n\nThe icon version should:\n- Be transparent PNG\n- Be approximately 64x36 pixels\n- Show just the championship belt face\n\nThe full-size version should:\n- Be high resolution (at least 800x600)\n- Show the entire championship belt\n- Be in JPG format for better compression\n\n## Background Images\n\nThe background images are SVG files that provide the visual styling for the different sections of the website. If you need to modify them:\n\n1. Edit the SVG files directly in a text editor or SVG editor\n2. Keep the same dimensions and general style for consistency\n3. Test the changes in different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>'}

Copy one of the existing superstar profile HTML files (e.g., `src/pages/cody-rhodes.html`)\n2. Rename it to match the new superstar\'s name (e.g., `randy-orton.html`)\n3. Update all the information in the file to match the new superstar\n4. Add the superstar\'s image to `src/assets/images/superstars/`\n5. Update links in other pages to point to this new profile\n\n### Required Information for Each Profile\n\nFor each superstar profile, you should include:\n\n- **Personal Information**\n  - Real name\n  - Birthdate and age\n  - Birthplace\n  - Height and weight\n  - Debut date\n  - Finisher moves\n  - Theme song\n  - Current alignment (Face/Heel/Tweener)\n\n- **Biography**\n  - Early life and background\n  - How they got into wrestling\n  - Major career milestones\n  - Current status\n\n- **Championship History**\n  - World championships\n  - Other championships\n  - Dates and events where titles were won\n\n- **Accomplishments**\n  - Tournament wins\n  - Awards and accolades\n  - Records held\n\n- **Career Highlights**\n  - Timeline of major events\n  - Significant matches\n  - Character changes\n  - Memorable moments\n\n## Adding the Superstar to Navigation\n\nAfter creating a new superstar profile, make sure to:\n\n1. Add them to the appropriate section in `src/pages/superstars.html`\n2. Update any related superstar sections in other profiles\n3. Consider adding them to the featured superstars on the homepage if they\'re a top star\n\n## Image Guidelines\n\nFor superstar images:\n\n1. Use square images (1:1 aspect ratio)\n2. Focus on the face and upper body\n3. Use high-resolution images (at least 300x300 pixels)\n4. Name the file after the superstar with lowercase letters and hyphens (e.g., `randy-orton.jpg`)\n5. Place the image in `src/assets/images/superstars/`\n\nYou can use the placeholder generator tool to create temporary images:\n\n```bash\nnode src/tools/generate-placeholder-images.js\n```\n\n## Keeping Information Up-to-Date\n\nWWE storylines and championships change frequently. To keep the website current:\n\n1. Update championship information when title changes occur\n2. Update superstar profiles with new accomplishments and storylines\n3. Update brand affiliations when superstars move between Raw, SmackDown, and NXT\n4. Update images when superstars change their appearance significantly\n\nUse the championship update tool to quickly update championship information:\n\n```bash\nnpm run update-champion "Championship Name" "New Champion Name" "Event Name" "Date"\n```\n\n## Testing Links\n\nAfter adding new profiles or updating existing ones, always test:\n\n1. Navigation links to ensure they point to the correct pages\n2. Related superstar links to ensure they work properly\n3. Championship links to ensure they point to the correct championship pages\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>'}
