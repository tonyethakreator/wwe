Copy one of the existing superstar profile HTML files (e.g., `src/pages/cody-rhodes.html`)\n2. Rename it to match the new superstar\'s name (e.g., `randy-orton.html`)\n3. Update all the information in the file to match the new superstar\n4. Add the superstar\'s image to `src/assets/images/superstars/`\n5. Update links in other pages to point to this new profile\n\n### Required Information for Each Profile\n\nFor each superstar profile, you should include:\n\n- **Personal Information**\n  - Real name\n  - Birthdate and age\n  - Birthplace\n  - Height and weight\n  - Debut date\n  - Finisher moves\n  - Theme song\n  - Current alignment (Face/Heel/Tweener)\n\n- **Biography**\n  - Early life and background\n  - How they got into wrestling\n  - Major career milestones\n  - Current status\n\n- **Championship History**\n  - World championships\n  - Other championships\n  - Dates and events where titles were won\n\n- **Accomplishments**\n  - Tournament wins\n  - Awards and accolades\n  - Records held\n\n- **Career Highlights**\n  - Timeline of major events\n  - Significant matches\n  - Character changes\n  - Memorable moments\n\n## Adding the Superstar to Navigation\n\nAfter creating a new superstar profile, make sure to:\n\n1. Add them to the appropriate section in `src/pages/superstars.html`\n2. Update any related superstar sections in other profiles\n3. Consider adding them to the featured superstars on the homepage if they\'re a top star\n\n## Image Guidelines\n\nFor superstar images:\n\n1. Use square images (1:1 aspect ratio)\n2. Focus on the face and upper body\n3. Use high-resolution images (at least 300x300 pixels)\n4. Name the file after the superstar with lowercase letters and hyphens (e.g., `randy-orton.jpg`)\n5. Place the image in `src/assets/images/superstars/`\n\nYou can use the placeholder generator tool to create temporary images:\n\n```bash\nnode src/tools/generate-placeholder-images.js\n```\n\n## Keeping Information Up-to-Date\n\nWWE storylines and championships change frequently. To keep the website current:\n\n1. Update championship information when title changes occur\n2. Update superstar profiles with new accomplishments and storylines\n3. Update brand affiliations when superstars move between Raw, SmackDown, and NXT\n4. Update images when superstars change their appearance significantly\n\nUse the championship update tool to quickly update championship information:\n\n```bash\nnpm run update-champion "Championship Name" "New Champion Name" "Event Name" "Date"\n```\n\n## Testing Links\n\nAfter adding new profiles or updating existing ones, always test:\n\n1. Navigation links to ensure they point to the correct pages\n2. Related superstar links to ensure they work properly\n3. Championship links to ensure they point to the correct championship pages\n</create-file>\n</function_calls>'}
